# Sales Dashboard made using Power Bi

Sales Dashboard made to visualize KPI often used. 
The goal was to be able to select by year and month and show Sales vs. Budget along with sales by customers and by product. 
Slicers added to sort by city, category, and name of product. 

Second page was added to include a matrix table of sales by customers by months and a third page for a breakdown of sales by products. 
Because I cannot make a Microsoft Fabric account, I can only post screenshots here.

First Page

Overview page with sales and budget slicers, bar graphs for top 10 products and top 25 customers, pie chart for product mix
and a line graph and map because maps are neat. Sales seem to be more focused on the extreme east and west side of the United States. For Europe, its mostly in
Germany, UK, and specifically Paris, France. Australia sales are mostly on the east coast side of the country. 

Second page

The second page is basically the matrix table with sales by customer names for the month. You can change this by the year with the slicer or just see if they tend 
to make more purchases in certain months every year. It seems we sell a lot of bikes in the beginning of the year, quite possibly because of New Year resolutions,
and it increases during the Summer time for camping and hiking, and as expected Fall and Winter are much slower times of the year. 

Third Page

Third page is the product sales by months. Again, useful to see if there are any particular months that sell more than others, or maybe it was just
a certain year that boomed. And of course seeing which products sell more than others. Most popular products seem to be the Mountain 200, Road 150 and 250, and the Touring 1000. 
Most of the Mountain, Road, and Touring series sell well, Sport models on the other are not as popular.
